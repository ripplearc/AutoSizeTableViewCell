# What to learn
:mortar_board:`UIStackView` hides the tediousness and complexity of the `Auto Layout`. It cuts the number of constraints needed for Auto Layout, and thus makes it effortlesss to hide some of its `arragedSubviews` or alter their sizes at runtime. This lab unveils UIStackView's flexibility by building an autosizing `UITableViewCell`.

# What to build
:construction_worker: In this lab, we will build a **TechCrunch** table view to show the catalog of its news. Simple as it looks, the building process manifests how UIStackView can auto sizes the its height when the content size needs to grow, and how UIStackView takes care of the layout when certain arrangedSubviews are hidden.

# How to learn
